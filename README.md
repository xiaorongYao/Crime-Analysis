# Crime-Analysis
A data analysis project created for UMJI Intro to computers and programming.  
Datasets are found on https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2.

If there are similar problems or projects in the future, JI students are responsible for not copying or modifying these codes or files, as this would be against the Honor Code.
